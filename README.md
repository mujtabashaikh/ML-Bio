Demonstration code for my research paper "The State-of-Art Machine Learning In Bioinformatics" with python.


A branch of artificial intelligence machine learning that provide enormous variety of statistical and probabilistic method that enables the computers to “learn” from historical data. It is widely use in health care domain we use this technology to predict/detect the breast cancer prognosis and detect the cancer from enormous, nosy or complicated bioinformatics dataset. The application of machine learning models bring to us accurate predictions on complex measurements. We use machine learning model to prediction of survival time in breast cancer on the basis of bioinformatics data set. The paper has discussion on the problem on breast cancer with knowledge mixture of bioinformatics and machine learning the decision is made with different attribute like clump thickness, uniformity size ,mitosis etc. The machine learning provide us different set of algorithms we use support vector machine(SVM), Logistic regression and random forest to get the promising result these mode achieve most accurate survival prognosis results.
The paper is based on machine learning algorithms that aim to build a model that accurately differentiate between benign and malignant breast tumours. The cross validation for accuracy of the model demonstrate the best performance on the breast cancer data. A python work flow has been developed and improvement discuss in this paper.
